# Business Analytics Student Survey

## Description
The Business Analytics Student Survey is a web-based form designed to gather information from BAIS students. It consists of multiple pages with various questions aimed at understanding students' backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives.

## Best Practices for Forms
When developing the web form for this project, several best practices for forms were adhered to ensure a positive user experience. Firstly, clear and descriptive labels were used for each input field to provide users with context and guidance. Additionally, input validation was implemented to prevent errors and ensure that users provide accurate data. This validation includes required fields, appropriate input types (such as text, select, and checkbox), and constraints on input length where necessary.

Moreover, the form was designed to be easily navigable and user-friendly. Sequential ordering of questions helps users understand the flow of information, and logical grouping of related questions improves readability. Furthermore, the use of appropriate input controls, such as select dropdowns for predefined options and checkboxes for multiple selections, enhances usability and efficiency.

## User Accessibility
Ensuring accessibility is crucial to make the web form usable by all individuals, including those with disabilities. To achieve this, several accessibility features were incorporated into the form. Firstly, all input fields were provided with clear and descriptive labels to assist users using screen readers. Additionally, the form was designed with keyboard accessibility in mind, allowing users to navigate and interact with the form using only keyboard inputs. Furthermore, proper use of semantic HTML elements and attributes, such as the "label" element and "alt" attribute for images, improves compatibility with assistive technologies and enhances the overall accessibility of the form.

In summary, adherence to best practices for forms and a focus on user accessibility ensure that the Business Analytics Student Survey is inclusive and accessible to all users, providing a seamless experience for data collection.
